The cook correctly recognized the small-tined projectile as a Kamino saberdart. Few have ever heard of the planet Kamino, but Dex not only informed Obi-Wan as to its location (12 parsecs south of the Rishi Maze), but also its inhabitants. Dex warned that the native Kaminoans -- cloners of some repute -- keep to themselves, but are welcoming to those with the credits to spare.",

They hail from the oceans of Mon Cala, a planet they share with the Quarren. During the Clone Wars, differences between the two cultures were fanned by Separatist troublemakers to erupt in civil war.    During the Galactic Civil War, the Mon Calamari were said to be the soul of the Rebel Alliance. The Empire pressed these gentle, amphibious people into war by subjugating their watery world. In retaliation, the Mon Calamari became one of the key species of the Rebellion, supplying badly needed warships to the outnumbered Alliance fleet.",

They are  extremely skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology like gliders and catapults. They are quick learners when exposed to advanced technology, however.    The Ewoks accepted members of the Rebel Alliance into their tribe, and allied themselves to their cause. The Ewoks helped in the ground battle to destroy the Imperial shield generator built in their forests, and their primitive weapons felled the stormtroopers and the scout walkers of the Empire. Their help paved the way to victory at the Battle of Endor.",

Their skeletal structure is extremely flexible, as it is made of cartilaginous material rather than hard bone. The long Gungan face has a tough yet flexible bill for burrowing and rooting out food. They have long muscular tongues with which they scoop mollusks and lesser amphibians from the Naboo swamps. While most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they have developed an advanced technology.",

Their most distinctive feature is a pair of shapely prehensile tentacles that grow from the base of their skulls.    Few things are as graceful as a female Twi'lek in motion. This beautiful image has forever doomed generations of young Twi'leks into servitude, as the wealthy and corrupt have taken to brandishing Twi'leks as badges of prestige.    In the waning years of the Republic, the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth was represented in the Galactic Senate by the corpulent blue-skinned politician Orn Free Taa. Even a politician of high office was not above flaunting a pair of lovely Twi'lek aides as a sign of influence and wealth.",

When peaceful, Wookiees are tender and gentle. Their tempers, however, are short; when angered, Wookiees can fly into a berserker rage and will not stop until the object of their distemper is sufficiently destroyed.",

An influential world, Alderaan was represented in the waning days of the Republic by such venerated politicians as Bail Antilles and Bail Organa. A peaceful world, Alderaan was bereft of weaponry in an era of galactic strife. It was not without spirit, however. Alderaan was one of the earliest supporters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, though its officials prudently kept all ties to the Rebellion secret. Despite such discretion, the Empire knew it to be a haven of Rebel activity, and Grand Moff Tarkin targeted the beautiful world for reprisal as soon as the Death Star was operational. The massive primary weapon of the battle station obliterated Alderaan, leaving only a lifeless asteroid field behind.",

Though it lacked civilization, the planet was teeming with life -- from its dense, jungle undergrowth to its diverse animal population. Home to a number of fairly common reptilian and amphibious creatures, Dagobah also boasted an indigenous population of much more massive -- and mysterious -- lifeforms. Surrounded by creatures generating the living Force, Yoda learned to connect with the deeper cosmic Force and waited for one who might bring about the return of the Jedi Order.",

The most well known of these ventures is the opulent Cloud City, formerly under the administration of Lando Calrissian. During the tail end of the Galactic Civil War, the Empire garrisoned Bespin and took over Cloud City, though the outpost and the planet enjoyed freedom after the defeat of the Emperor at the Battle of Endor.",

Unfortunately, combat did come to Saleucami, and it was a major battle site during the Outer Rim Sieges of the Clone Wars.",

It was manufactured by Ubrikkian, measuring 30 meters long and equipped with a heavy blaster cannon -- an essential feature for Jabba’s lifestyle. Indeed, the craft was symbolic of Jabba’s hubris and ego, and played a large part in his downfall.",

They were extremely durable making them an austere choice for desert climes and perfect transports for passengers, cargo, or slaves for the Hutt Crime Syndicate or the slave traders of Zygerria. They were little more than floating platforms, and easily identified by their rust coloring, reinforced bows, and intermittent guard-rails around the perimeter. They came equipped with planks, making them the preferred execution conveyance for the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt, who loved to drop his enemies into pits full of monsters. Shortly before his untimely demise, Jabba forced Luke Skywalker to walk a skiff’s plank over the Great Pit of Carkoon. That was the last mistake he ever made.",

While droid starfighters are capable of maneuvers that would crush even the sturdiest organic pilot, they lack the resourcefulness and cunning that living pilots bring into combat. To counter their shortcomings, vulture droids often attack en masse. Like the ground-based battle droid infantry, vulture droids were, for a time, controlled by a central command ship, but later generations were granted a limited degree of independence. When not in flight, the droid starfighter can transform into a walking mode allowing them to be used in surface patrols.",

The front of the gunship features hunchback-style cockpit bubbles, wherein the gunship pilot and copilot / gunner sit in single file. Chin-mounted on the craft are a pair of laser cannon turrets. On the gunship's dorsal surface are its primary armaments, two massive rocket launchers fed by a rear-mounted missile belts.",

        "description": "Lightning-quick, the TSMEU-6 wheel bike was General Grievous’ vehicle of choice during the Separatist invasion of Utapau. As its name implied, the wheel bike featured a large wheel which would spin and give the transport its fast movement and maneuverability. The TSMEU-6 was a single-passenger vehicle, with one seat next to its wheel, and could reach speeds of up to 330 kilometers per hour when rolling, and 10 kilometers per hour when running on its retractable legs. It also had significant firepower, with a powerful double laser cannon. Despite this functionality, Grievous’ wheel bike would be destroyed during a failed attempt to flee from Obi-Wan Kenobi in one of the last battles of the Clone Wars.",

The legs are low to the ground, which reduces the walker's top speed but does provide it with increased stability. The body of the walker consists of two armored halves connected by a flexible sleeve that increases its mobility on the field. The walker is truly all terrain, able to climb sheer surfaces and survive in the vacuum of outer space.    The front of the walker is lined with four ball-turret laser cannons, while a single heavy projectile cannon is turret-mounted on the vehicle's dorsal surface. Its rear fire arc is protected by a pair of laser cannon turrets. Though the walker's armor can easily deflect small arms fire, tanksmasher rockets can pierce an AT-TE's armor and destroy its complex propulsion mechanisms.",

        "description": "Despite her humble origins and shabby exterior, the Millennium Falcon has played a role in some of the greatest victories of the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic. The Falcon looks like a worn-out junker, but beneath her hull she’s full of surprises. A succession of owners, from Lando Calrissian and Han Solo to Gannis Ducain, have made special modifications that boosted the freighter’s speed, shielding and firepower to impressive – and downright illegal – levels. The price of such tinkering? The Falcon can be unpredictable, with her hyperdrive particularly balky. Despite her flaws, she’s beloved by her owners – Han Solo and Chewbacca have spent years searching the galaxy for the ship they once called home.",

Located just below the engine cluster are a pair of S-foils which can deploy to extend the firing arc of twin laser cannons. The B-wing's command pod has a unique gyroscopic control system. The pilot can orient it so that it always stays level with a horizon line. No matter which way the B-wing may maneuver laterally, its pilot remains upright.",

Chancellor Valorum dispatched a Republic Cruiser carrying two important Jedi ambassadors to negotiate an end to the Trade Federation Blockade of Naboo. The cruiser docked within a Trade Federation battleship's cavernous landing bay. On the orders of Darth Sidious, the Trade Federation ambushed the Jedi ambassadors. The crew of the cruiser was caught by surprise, destroyed by a concealed turbolaser turret.",

With skilled pilots such as Anakin Skywalker and Saesee Tiin at the controls, Delta-7s were lightning-quick in combat, darting in for attack runs and then skipping nimbly away from retaliatory fire. During one famous encounter, Obi-Wan Kenobi piloted a Delta-7 through Geonosis’s planetary ring, pursued by Jango Fett in his starship Slave I. Plo Koon was piloting his Delta-7 above Cato Neimoidia when Chancellor Palpatine ordered the clones to execute Order 66. Plo’s wingman caught the Jedi General by surprise and blew his fighter out of the sky.",

The disk is broken at the front of the craft, revealing two mammoth docking bays lined with forward docking claws. The reclusive Neimoidian commanders typically seal themselves in the ship's spacious bridge while their legions of droids handle the operation of the mighty craft. The most important vessel in a Separatist battleship flotilla is the Droid Control Ship, which transmitted signals to the battle droid armies used by the Trade Federation and Separatist forces.",

Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi flew Eta-2s during the Battle of Coruscant, where Obi-Wan’s fighter was badly damaged by Separatist buzz droids.

Appearing in a variety of shapes and sizes and sometimes augmented for other functions, including acension guns that fire grappling hooks, blaster pistols deliver a wide range of damage capability. Many blaster pistols have stun settings that incapacitate a target, rather than inflicting physical damage. While blasters do deliver a searing concussive blast, they can be foiled by magnetic seals and deflector shields.",

Within the cavernous Senate rotunda, hundreds of politicians would fill the viewing platforms that lined the curved walls. The Senate’s power gradually eroded after it voted emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars, and the body was sharply divided between supporters of the war and those seeking peace. After Palpatine declared himself Emperor, power was increasingly wielded by regional governors. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Palpatine disbanded the Senate.",

Bowcasters are more powerful and accurate than blasters, firing a metal quarrel encased in plasma energy. Like many Wookiee creations, the bowcaster combines traditional craftsmanship with galactic technology. Noted bowcaster wielders include Chewbacca and the bounty hunter Embo.",

They were fast and nimble and could maintain sustained flight as well as short bursts for tactical advantages in combat. The jetpacks could be equipped with a top-loaded rocket firing missile that could turn the tide in many a conflict. Their significant disadvantage was their vulnerability to external impact damage. One sharp blow with a stick could conceivably ignite the jetpack, causing all manner of unwanted performance that could lead to significant bodily harm or even death.",

That policy aroused the ire of rebel hero Leia Organa, who warned that elements of the Empire were still seeking power. Sidelined from the political process, Organa founded the Resistance to oppose the Empire’s successor state, the mysterious First Order.",

The amphibians have long maintained a huge standing army -- the Gungan Grand Army -- as one of their proudest traditions.  The Gungans prefer technology that is harmonious with the ecology of their world. Their weaponry is no different. The Gungan Grand Army uses domesticated animals for transport -- Gungan scouts ride swift-footed kaadu into combat, while hardy falumpasets and fambaas haul heavy weapons and shield generators into place.",

They came in various sizes and could be launched by hand, sling, or even catapult.",

Once the bearers cleared the grid, the Podracers' massive engines would roar to life, seemingly anxious at the chance to soar at speeds exceeding 700 kilometers-per-hour. Eighteen Podracers competed to win the trophy that day. Anakin Skywalker survived to cross the finish line first, earning not only accolades, but his freedom from slavery.",

They were divided into ten clans of up to twenty younglings and trained in the Jedi arts. One of their rites of passage was “The Gathering,”which was the harvesting of kyber crystals for their lightsabers on the remote world of Ilum. The Jedi Younglings in the Jedi Temple during Order 66 were brutally slain by Darth Vader.",

The Naboo Royal Handmaidens have been selected for their various talents as well as for their resemblance to the Queen, which is useful if a decoy is required. After being invited to join the Queen's entourage, each handmaiden was trained in self defense and marksmanship. They often carry small, concealable blasters.",

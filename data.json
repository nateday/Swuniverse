Dr. Evazan tried to bully Luke Skywalker in the Mos Eisley cantina, boasting that he faced a death sentence in 12 systems. The doctor and his pal Ponda Baba assumed the young farmboy would be an easy target, and paid little heed to the old man in dusty robes who’d accompanied young Luke into the bar. That was a fatal mistake: when Evazan hurled Luke aside and pulled his blaster, Obi-Wan Kenobi coolly ignited his lightsaber and cut Evazan down.",

Ironically, Tarpals served under Binks, who had unexpectedly received the rank of general by Boss Nass himself. Tarpals stayed close to Binks, trying to keep his commanding officer out of trouble.     By the time of the Clone Wars, Tarpals was promoted to general, and served as leader of the Gungan Grand Army.",

When it spots a victim, the beast erupts from its lair and grabs the meal in its claws. Although quite fearsome, the colo claw fish is no match for the enormous sando aqua monster.",

They emerge as spheres and attach themselves to a target vessel, popping open to reveal an insect-like droid equipped with cutters and other tools of vandalism. The buzz droids are designed to disable, not destroy, enemy craft. They operate quickly, slicing into starship hulls. While their tools are effective, a hit to its central eye can knock a buzz droid out of commission.",

The destroyer droid can completely envelope itself in a globe of protective energy via its compact deflector shield generators, though at the expense of its mobility.

Cloud City exists not only as a mining colony, extracting valuable Tibanna gas from the depths of the giant planet, but also as a sanctuary for those trying to escape the turmoil gripping the galaxy.  Though profitable, Cloud City is small enough not to be noticed by larger authorities such as the Mining Guild. It prospered under the capable stewardship of Baron-Administrator Lando Calrissian. Calrissian, assisted by his aide Lobot, contended with self-sufficiency issues and labor difficulties throughout his brief term.",

There she cleaned equipment scavenged from the sands, cooked, slept, and dreamt of the day her family would return and take her away from Jakku.",

Eighteen Podracers competed to win the trophy that day. Anakin Skywalker survived to cross the finish line first, earning not only accolades, but his freedom from slavery.",

Within the cavernous Senate rotunda, hundreds of politicians would fill the viewing platforms that lined the curved walls. The Senate’s power gradually eroded after it voted emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars, and the body was sharply divided between supporters of the war and those seeking peace. After Palpatine declared himself Emperor, power was increasingly wielded by regional governors. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Palpatine disbanded the Senate.",

During one famous encounter, Obi-Wan Kenobi piloted a Delta-7 through Geonosis’s planetary ring, pursued by Jango Fett in his starship Slave I. Plo Koon was piloting his Delta-7 above Cato Neimoidia when Chancellor Palpatine ordered the clones to execute Order 66.

As its name implied, the wheel bike featured a large wheel which would spin and give the transport its fast movement and maneuverability. The TSMEU-6 was a single-passenger vehicle, with one seat next to its wheel, and could reach speeds of up to 330 kilometers per hour when rolling, and 10 kilometers per hour when running on its retractable legs. It also had significant firepower, with a powerful double laser cannon. Despite this functionality, Grievous’ wheel bike would be destroyed during a failed attempt to flee from Obi-Wan Kenobi in one of the last battles of the Clone Wars.",

The polished, streamlined J-type 327 Nubian vessel lacks any offensive weaponry, but does feature strong shields and a competent hyperdrive.    During the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo, Queen Amidala and her retinue escaped aboard the Royal Starship. Piloted by Ric Olie, the vessel narrowly avoided the Trade Federation blockade, though its hyperdrive was damaged. The ship limped to Tatooine, where a replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator was procured.",

        "description": "When stationed on Hoth, the Rebel Alliance modified T-47 airspeeders to become snowspeeders, fast flying conveyances for patrol and defense of their hidden base. It took some doing to keep the crippling cold from permanently grounding their airforce, but Rebel ingenuity overcame the relentless Hoth elements. The T-47 airspeeder is a small, wedge-shaped craft with two forward-facing laser cannons. In its rear arc is a harpoon gun fitted with a heavy-duty tow cable. The snowspeeder is a two-man vessel, with a pilot and rear-facing tailgunner.",

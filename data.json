They hail from the oceans of Mon Cala, a planet they share with the Quarren. During the Clone Wars, differences between the two cultures were fanned by Separatist troublemakers to erupt in civil war.    During the Galactic Civil War, the Mon Calamari were said to be the soul of the Rebel Alliance. The Empire pressed these gentle, amphibious people into war by subjugating their watery world. In retaliation, the Mon Calamari became one of the key species of the Rebellion, supplying badly needed warships to the outnumbered Alliance fleet.",

They are  extremely skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology like gliders and catapults. They are quick learners when exposed to advanced technology, however.    The Ewoks accepted members of the Rebel Alliance into their tribe, and allied themselves to their cause. The Ewoks helped in the ground battle to destroy the Imperial shield generator built in their forests, and their primitive weapons felled the stormtroopers and the scout walkers of the Empire. Their help paved the way to victory at the Battle of Endor.",

Their skeletal structure is extremely flexible, as it is made of cartilaginous material rather than hard bone. The long Gungan face has a tough yet flexible bill for burrowing and rooting out food. They have long muscular tongues with which they scoop mollusks and lesser amphibians from the Naboo swamps. While most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they have developed an advanced technology.",

Their most distinctive feature is a pair of shapely prehensile tentacles that grow from the base of their skulls.    Few things are as graceful as a female Twi'lek in motion. This beautiful image has forever doomed generations of young Twi'leks into servitude, as the wealthy and corrupt have taken to brandishing Twi'leks as badges of prestige.    In the waning years of the Republic, the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth was represented in the Galactic Senate by the corpulent blue-skinned politician Orn Free Taa. Even a politician of high office was not above flaunting a pair of lovely Twi'lek aides as a sign of influence and wealth.",

Despite their fearsome and savage countenance, Wookiees are intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. Loyalty and bravery are near-sacred tenets in Wookiee society. When peaceful, Wookiees are tender and gentle. Their tempers, however, are short; when angered, Wookiees can fly into a berserker rage and will not stop until the object of their distemper is sufficiently destroyed.",

An influential world, Alderaan was represented in the waning days of the Republic by such venerated politicians as Bail Antilles and Bail Organa. A peaceful world, Alderaan was bereft of weaponry in an era of galactic strife. It was not without spirit, however. Alderaan was one of the earliest supporters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, though its officials prudently kept all ties to the Rebellion secret. Despite such discretion, the Empire knew it to be a haven of Rebel activity, and Grand Moff Tarkin targeted the beautiful world for reprisal as soon as the Death Star was operational. The massive primary weapon of the battle station obliterated Alderaan, leaving only a lifeless asteroid field behind.",

Though it lacked civilization, the planet was teeming with life -- from its dense, jungle undergrowth to its diverse animal population. Home to a number of fairly common reptilian and amphibious creatures, Dagobah also boasted an indigenous population of much more massive -- and mysterious -- lifeforms. Surrounded by creatures generating the living Force, Yoda learned to connect with the deeper cosmic Force and waited for one who might bring about the return of the Jedi Order.",

While droid starfighters are capable of maneuvers that would crush even the sturdiest organic pilot, they lack the resourcefulness and cunning that living pilots bring into combat. To counter their shortcomings, vulture droids often attack en masse. Like the ground-based battle droid infantry, vulture droids were, for a time, controlled by a central command ship, but later generations were granted a limited degree of independence. When not in flight, the droid starfighter can transform into a walking mode allowing them to be used in surface patrols.",

Manufactured by the Techno Union, they were fast, well-armored, were well-suited to a variety of terrain, and had significant firepower. One enterprising young wookiee managed to destroy one with an explosive charge in one of the final battles of the Clone Wars on Kashyyyk.",

The legs are low to the ground, which reduces the walker's top speed but does provide it with increased stability. The body of the walker consists of two armored halves connected by a flexible sleeve that increases its mobility on the field. The walker is truly all terrain, able to climb sheer surfaces and survive in the vacuum of outer space.    The front of the walker is lined with four ball-turret laser cannons, while a single heavy projectile cannon is turret-mounted on the vehicle's dorsal surface. Its rear fire arc is protected by a pair of laser cannon turrets. Though the walker's armor can easily deflect small arms fire, tanksmasher rockets can pierce an AT-TE's armor and destroy its complex propulsion mechanisms.",

Located just below the engine cluster are a pair of S-foils which can deploy to extend the firing arc of twin laser cannons. The B-wing's command pod has a unique gyroscopic control system.

Piloted by Ric Olie, the vessel narrowly avoided the Trade Federation blockade, though its hyperdrive was damaged. The ship limped to Tatooine, where a replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator was procured.",

With skilled pilots such as Anakin Skywalker and Saesee Tiin at the controls, Delta-7s were lightning-quick in combat, darting in for attack runs and then skipping nimbly away from retaliatory fire. During one famous encounter, Obi-Wan Kenobi piloted a Delta-7 through Geonosis’s planetary ring, pursued by Jango Fett in his starship Slave I. Plo Koon was piloting his Delta-7 above Cato Neimoidia when Chancellor Palpatine ordered the clones to execute Order 66.

The demands of combat drove advancements in the Jedi starfighter arsenal, resulting in modifications to existing craft and a new generation of fighters. The Eta-2 was smaller than the earlier Delta-7 but boasted greater firepower. Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi flew Eta-2s during the Battle of Coruscant, where Obi-Wan’s fighter was badly damaged by Separatist buzz droids. Some design elements of the Eta-2 were later incorporated into the Empire’s TIE fighters.",

Within the cavernous Senate rotunda, hundreds of politicians would fill the viewing platforms that lined the curved walls. The Senate’s power gradually eroded after it voted emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars, and the body was sharply divided between supporters of the war and those seeking peace. After Palpatine declared himself Emperor, power was increasingly wielded by regional governors. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Palpatine disbanded the Senate.",

After attaining the rank of Jedi Master, Obi-Wan built a third saber, also with a blue plasma blade.

They were fast and nimble and could maintain sustained flight as well as short bursts for tactical advantages in combat. The jetpacks could be equipped with a top-loaded rocket firing missile that could turn the tide in many a conflict. Their significant disadvantage was their vulnerability to external impact damage. One sharp blow with a stick could conceivably ignite the jetpack, causing all manner of unwanted performance that could lead to significant bodily harm or even death.",

The cybernetic implant, however, would often erase the personality of its subject and, occasionally, cause their behavior to become erratic. Lando Calrissian's aide utilized the technology, as did a Rodian named Tseebo, who used the Lobot-Tech headgear to steal Imperial data and plans.",

Eager to win over the war-weary citizens of the galaxy, the New Republic revived the Senate, signed a peace treaty – the Galactic Concordance – with the Empire’s remnants, and drastically reduced its military capabilities. That policy aroused the ire of rebel hero Leia Organa, who warned that elements of the Empire were still seeking power. Sidelined from the political process, Organa founded the Resistance to oppose the Empire’s successor state, the mysterious First Order.",

Maul’s dexterity and extensive training allowed him to use his weapon as a single-bladed saber, or to activate both crimson blades and fight multiple opponents at once. On Naboo, Maul killed Qui-Gon Jinn with his saber, but Obi-Wan Kenobi cut his weapon in half and soon did the same to Maul. Unknown to Obi-Wan, Maul survived, and retained the working half of his weapon. He used this single-bladed saber while leading the Shadow Collective.",

They hail from the oceans of Mon Cala, a planet they share with the Quarren. During the Clone Wars, differences between the two cultures were fanned by Separatist troublemakers to erupt in civil war.    During the Galactic Civil War, the Mon Calamari were said to be the soul of the Rebel Alliance. The Empire pressed these gentle, amphibious people into war by subjugating their watery world. In retaliation, the Mon Calamari became one of the key species of the Rebellion, supplying badly needed warships to the outnumbered Alliance fleet.",

They are  extremely skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology like gliders and catapults. They are quick learners when exposed to advanced technology, however.    The Ewoks accepted members of the Rebel Alliance into their tribe, and allied themselves to their cause. The Ewoks helped in the ground battle to destroy the Imperial shield generator built in their forests, and their primitive weapons felled the stormtroopers and the scout walkers of the Empire. Their help paved the way to victory at the Battle of Endor.",

Their skeletal structure is extremely flexible, as it is made of cartilaginous material rather than hard bone. The long Gungan face has a tough yet flexible bill for burrowing and rooting out food. They have long muscular tongues with which they scoop mollusks and lesser amphibians from the Naboo swamps. While most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they have developed an advanced technology.",

Their most distinctive feature is a pair of shapely prehensile tentacles that grow from the base of their skulls.    Few things are as graceful as a female Twi'lek in motion. This beautiful image has forever doomed generations of young Twi'leks into servitude, as the wealthy and corrupt have taken to brandishing Twi'leks as badges of prestige.    In the waning years of the Republic, the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth was represented in the Galactic Senate by the corpulent blue-skinned politician Orn Free Taa. Even a politician of high office was not above flaunting a pair of lovely Twi'lek aides as a sign of influence and wealth.",

An influential world, Alderaan was represented in the waning days of the Republic by such venerated politicians as Bail Antilles and Bail Organa. A peaceful world, Alderaan was bereft of weaponry in an era of galactic strife. It was not without spirit, however. Alderaan was one of the earliest supporters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, though its officials prudently kept all ties to the Rebellion secret. Despite such discretion, the Empire knew it to be a haven of Rebel activity, and Grand Moff Tarkin targeted the beautiful world for reprisal as soon as the Death Star was operational. The massive primary weapon of the battle station obliterated Alderaan, leaving only a lifeless asteroid field behind.",

Though it lacked civilization, the planet was teeming with life -- from its dense, jungle undergrowth to its diverse animal population. Home to a number of fairly common reptilian and amphibious creatures, Dagobah also boasted an indigenous population of much more massive -- and mysterious -- lifeforms. Surrounded by creatures generating the living Force, Yoda learned to connect with the deeper cosmic Force and waited for one who might bring about the return of the Jedi Order.",

The most well known of these ventures is the opulent Cloud City, formerly under the administration of Lando Calrissian. During the tail end of the Galactic Civil War, the Empire garrisoned Bespin and took over Cloud City, though the outpost and the planet enjoyed freedom after the defeat of the Emperor at the Battle of Endor.",

It features towering skyscrapers, streams of speeder-filled air traffic, and inner levels that stretch far below the world’s surface. Coruscant was the seat of government for the Galactic Republic and the Empire that followed, and was the site of numerous historic events during the Clone Wars. It also housed the Jedi Temple and Archives, which hosted Jedi training and learning for over a thousand generations -- traditions that ended when the planet bore witness to Order 66.",

Tatooine’s many dangers include sandstorms, bands of savage Tusken Raiders, and carnivorous krayt dragons. The planet is also known for its dangerous Podraces, rampant gambling, and legalized slavery. Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker both grew up on Tatooine, and Obi-Wan Kenobi spent years in hiding on this desolate world.",

It was manufactured by Ubrikkian, measuring 30 meters long and equipped with a heavy blaster cannon -- an essential feature for Jabba’s lifestyle. Indeed, the craft was symbolic of Jabba’s hubris and ego, and played a large part in his downfall.",

        "description": "The Bantha-II cargo skiff was a common repulsor-based transport outside the Republic (and later the Empire.) They were extremely durable making them an austere choice for desert climes and perfect transports for passengers, cargo, or slaves for the Hutt Crime Syndicate or the slave traders of Zygerria. They were little more than floating platforms, and easily identified by their rust coloring, reinforced bows, and intermittent guard-rails around the perimeter. They came equipped with planks, making them the preferred execution conveyance for the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt, who loved to drop his enemies into pits full of monsters. Shortly before his untimely demise, Jabba forced Luke Skywalker to walk a skiff’s plank over the Great Pit of Carkoon. That was the last mistake he ever made.",

While droid starfighters are capable of maneuvers that would crush even the sturdiest organic pilot, they lack the resourcefulness and cunning that living pilots bring into combat. To counter their shortcomings, vulture droids often attack en masse. Like the ground-based battle droid infantry, vulture droids were, for a time, controlled by a central command ship, but later generations were granted a limited degree of independence. When not in flight, the droid starfighter can transform into a walking mode allowing them to be used in surface patrols.",

Despite this functionality, Grievous’ wheel bike would be destroyed during a failed attempt to flee from Obi-Wan Kenobi in one of the last battles of the Clone Wars.",

The legs are low to the ground, which reduces the walker's top speed but does provide it with increased stability. The body of the walker consists of two armored halves connected by a flexible sleeve that increases its mobility on the field. The walker is truly all terrain, able to climb sheer surfaces and survive in the vacuum of outer space.    The front of the walker is lined with four ball-turret laser cannons, while a single heavy projectile cannon is turret-mounted on the vehicle's dorsal surface. Its rear fire arc is protected by a pair of laser cannon turrets. Though the walker's armor can easily deflect small arms fire, tanksmasher rockets can pierce an AT-TE's armor and destroy its complex propulsion mechanisms.",

The polished, streamlined J-type 327 Nubian vessel lacks any offensive weaponry, but does feature strong shields and a competent hyperdrive.    During the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo, Queen Amidala and her retinue escaped aboard the Royal Starship. Piloted by Ric Olie, the vessel narrowly avoided the Trade Federation blockade, though its hyperdrive was damaged. The ship limped to Tatooine, where a replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator was procured.",

The Delta-7’s designers worked with the Jedi to create a starfighter for pilots with Force-aided reflexes, stripping down the fighters’ systems and making their controls as responsive as possible. With skilled pilots such as Anakin Skywalker and Saesee Tiin at the controls, Delta-7s were lightning-quick in combat, darting in for attack runs and then skipping nimbly away from retaliatory fire. During one famous encounter, Obi-Wan Kenobi piloted a Delta-7 through Geonosis’s planetary ring, pursued by Jango Fett in his starship Slave I. Plo Koon was piloting his Delta-7 above Cato Neimoidia when Chancellor Palpatine ordered the clones to execute Order 66. Plo’s wingman caught the Jedi General by surprise and blew his fighter out of the sky.",

Dooku’s solar sailer brought him from Geonosis to Coruscant after the opening battle of the Clone Wars, and he later lent solar sailers to his apprentices Asajj Ventress and Savage Opress.",

The front half of the ship's spine contained a massive flight deck capable of scrambling the latest in Republic starfighters. The huge hangar doors opened to allow ships to land or takeoff from the deck; the vessel also had a smaller docking bay entrance on its lower side.",

Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi flew Eta-2s during the Battle of Coruscant, where Obi-Wan’s fighter was badly damaged by Separatist buzz droids. Some design elements of the Eta-2 were later incorporated into the Empire’s TIE fighters.",

He carried this blue-bladed Jedi weapon throughout the Clone Wars, wielding it in many battles. Anakin kept this second lightsaber after he pledged himself to Darth Sidious, using it in his duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar. Thinking Anakin would die, Obi-Wan took his lightsaber and kept it on Tatooine for nearly two decades. He then gave it to Luke Skywalker, who lost it when Darth Vader – the saber’s original owner – struck off his son’s hand in Cloud City.",

Appearing in a variety of shapes and sizes and sometimes augmented for other functions, including acension guns that fire grappling hooks, blaster pistols deliver a wide range of damage capability. Many blaster pistols have stun settings that incapacitate a target, rather than inflicting physical damage. While blasters do deliver a searing concussive blast, they can be foiled by magnetic seals and deflector shields.",

Within the cavernous Senate rotunda, hundreds of politicians would fill the viewing platforms that lined the curved walls. The Senate’s power gradually eroded after it voted emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars, and the body was sharply divided between supporters of the war and those seeking peace. After Palpatine declared himself Emperor, power was increasingly wielded by regional governors. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Palpatine disbanded the Senate.",

After attaining the rank of Jedi Master, Obi-Wan built a third saber, also with a blue plasma blade. He used this saber until he sacrificed his life aboard the Death Star, allowing himself to be struck down by Darth Vader so Luke Skywalker could escape.",

The jetpacks could be equipped with a top-loaded rocket firing missile that could turn the tide in many a conflict. Their significant disadvantage was their vulnerability to external impact damage. One sharp blow with a stick could conceivably ignite the jetpack, causing all manner of unwanted performance that could lead to significant bodily harm or even death.",

The charismatic former Jedi Count Dooku was the Alliance’s political leader, while its military power came from credits and assets donated by powerful galactic trade groups. No one suspected that the Alliance was actually a tool of Darth Sidious, who had engineered the Clone Wars as part of a Sith plot to rule the galaxy.",

Once the bearers cleared the grid, the Podracers' massive engines would roar to life, seemingly anxious at the chance to soar at speeds exceeding 700 kilometers-per-hour. Eighteen Podracers competed to win the trophy that day. Anakin Skywalker survived to cross the finish line first, earning not only accolades, but his freedom from slavery.",

        "description": "The Sith apprentice Darth Maul wielded a double-bladed lightsaber made by joining two hilts together end-to-end. Maul’s dexterity and extensive training allowed him to use his weapon as a single-bladed saber, or to activate both crimson blades and fight multiple opponents at once. On Naboo, Maul killed Qui-Gon Jinn with his saber, but Obi-Wan Kenobi cut his weapon in half and soon did the same to Maul. Unknown to Obi-Wan, Maul survived, and retained the working half of his weapon. He used this single-bladed saber while leading the Shadow Collective.",

        "description": "Each of the Empire’s Death Stars was built around a terrifying weapon – a superlaser array capable of destroying a planet. According to legend, the ancient Sith used massive kyber crystals to create superweapons; during the Clone Wars, the Geonosians revived the superlaser design. The Empire constructed the first Death Star in secret for nearly two decades before using it to destroy Alderaan; the second Death Star boasted a more powerful superlaser, with improved targeting sensors and power regulators.",
